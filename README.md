# tweet_a_fish
A twitter bot that retweet "teach a man to fish" jokes


## To do:

* make a file that trains up an sklearn package to identify which tweets are jokes
* make sure I have an exclude file so some words will never be retweeted
* Should I run it in the cloud or just off a desktop?
* 

# Requirements

* Python 3.x
* sklearn (should come with anaconda)
* tweepy
